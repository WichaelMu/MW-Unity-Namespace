## How to Use the Sandpit

To use the Sandpit, open MSandpit as a new project in Unity. MW was built and can be tested with ` Unity Engine 2021.1.3f1 `.

You can create and write scripts either through this MW Visual Studio Solution through ` Assembly-CSharp ` and by adding or modifying scripts in ` MScripts `. Alternatively, you can open scripts through Unity with your preconfigured text editor.

After building and compiling the MW Namespace at least once and ensuring that ` Assets/MW ` is populated with MW binaries, any scripts used by MSandpit should have access to the MW Namespace.

Test components and functionality as you would normally when *using* the MW Namespace.
