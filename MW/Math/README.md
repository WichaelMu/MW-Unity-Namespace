# MW.Math
This namespace provides many mathematical functions ranging from common game Kinematics, to fast Approximations for mathematical algorithms.

The usage of the MW.Math namespace exists in a number of namespaces, all in this one folder!
```cs
using MW.Math;		 // Common mathematics algorithms.
using MW.Kinetic;	 // Kinematic equations for game development.
using MW.Math.Magic; // Approximations, mostly using bit magic.
```
